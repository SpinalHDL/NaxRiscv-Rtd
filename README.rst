How to build this documentation
===============================

With venv
---------
Requirements (system)

* make
* git


Create a virtual environment with pipenv (will use the Pipfile for installing the necessary packages)

.. code:: shell

   python3 -m venv .venv

then you can activate the virtual enviroment (in bash) and install the dependencies

.. code:: shell

   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

and then you can use ``make`` the usual way

.. code:: shell

   make html     # for html
   make latex    # for latex
   make latexpdf # for latex (will require latexpdf installed)
   make          # list all the available output format

all the outputs will be in docs folder (for html: docs/html)

without virtualenv
------------------
Requirements (system):

* make
* git

Requirements (Python 3):

* sphinx
* sphinx-rtd-theme
* sphinxcontrib-wavedrom
* sphinx-multiversion

After installing the requirements you can run

.. code:: shell

   make html     # for html
   make latex    # for latex
   make latexpdf # for latex (will require latexpdf installed)
   make          # list all the available output format

you can create build multiple version of the doc via

.. code:: shell

   sphinx-multiversion source docs/html

in the docs/html there will be a folder with the builded doc for each branch and tag

Deploying the generated doc by hands
----------------------------------------

.. code:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalDoc-RTD.git --branch gh-pages deploy_tmp
   rm -rf deploy_tmp/*
   cp -r docs/html/* deploy_tmp/
   cd deploy_tmp/
   git add --all
   git commit -am "deploy"
   git push
   cd ..
   rm -rf deploy_tmp
