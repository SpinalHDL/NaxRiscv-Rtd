Side channel attack
---------------------

You can find an example of side channel attack here : 
https://github.com/SpinalHDL/NaxSoftware/tree/main/baremetal/side_channel/src
https://github.com/SpinalHDL/NaxSoftware/blob/main/baremetal/side_channel/src/side_channel.S

It is based on the speculative execution of memory loads and cache refill.
