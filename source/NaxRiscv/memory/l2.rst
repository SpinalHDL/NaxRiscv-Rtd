L2 cache
============================

The L2 cache has the following characteristics :

- Provide Tilelink interfaces (up for CPUS/DMA, down for the memories)
- Inclusive with L1 (only D$ for NaxRiscv), so it only send necessary probes, but always has a copy of the L1.
- PLRU line eviction
- non-blocking
- multi-way
- Data memory implemented as simple dual port ram (FPGA friendly)
- Support selective cachability of access in function of address / source (usefull to not cache video DMA accesses)


In its default configuration, its timings are : 
- Hit latency 5 cycles
- Miss latency penality 4 cycles

Its architecture is mostly : 

- Requests goes into a centralized tags fetcher / controller
- That controller can feed a few pipelines / FSM, as described bellow :
- Probe controller when it is needed to remove data from a l1 cache, may be required to evict a L2 cache line or to aquire unique permissions
- Read down.a when we need to either refill a cache line or do a uncached read access
- Send direct responses to up.d, for instance on a up.c.release
- Send request to the data collector, which can then write the main memory / cache and also send data to up.d
- Send request to the read cache, used on cache hit and cache evict
