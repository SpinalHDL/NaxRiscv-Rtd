Hardware description
============================

NaxRiscv was designed using SpinalHDL (A Scala hardware description library). 
One goal of the implementation was to explore new hardware elaboration paradigmes as : 

- Automatic pipelining framework
- Distributed hardware elaboration
- Software paradigmes applied to hardware elaboration (ex : software interface)


A few notes about it : 

- You can get generate the Verilog or the VHDL from it.
- A whole chapter (:ref:`abstraction_hdl`) of the doc is dedicated to explore the different paradigmes used
